Assignment #: 5


Program due date: 12/12/18


Handed in date: 12/12/18


Source code file name(s):

LargeInteger.java
RsaKeyGen.java
RsaSign.java


Other file name(s) (if relevant):

info_sheet.txt


Does your program run without error?: No


If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your program run
correctly?:
Everything works correctly except for my modularExp() method. 

LargeInteger:
	multiply() and XGCD() work correctly

RsaKeyGen works correctly

RsaSign:
	Hashes generated correctly
	Signature is stored and read correctly
	The decryption and encryption values are generated using the correct steps and logic, but the values are incorrect due to my modularExp() method

The modularExp() method is the only piece of my project that leads to errors in signature decryption and encryption. My steps and overall project structure
are correct and consistent with the guidelines.



Additional comments to the grader:
Sorry to keep reiterating, but just being clear. The result of any errors in signature verification are only due to my incorrect modularExp() method and not due to my
overall project structure. I tried many different methods of calculating modular exponetiation. Most of which were logically correct, but were unusable as my division
helper method was too slow to compute the answer as the values grew to the scale needed for this project. As a result I ended up submitting one of my attempts that terminates
but does not always result in the correct answer.
